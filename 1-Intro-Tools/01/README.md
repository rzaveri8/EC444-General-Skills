#  Set up and Use GitHub

Author: Rubeena Zaveri, 2018-09-10

## Summary

I set up an individual and team repository and cloned these to my machine. In my repository I created a text file about my summer adventures and in a seperate branch edited the file to incluce a favorite colors text file. I pushed all of these changes and merched the branches into the main branch.
