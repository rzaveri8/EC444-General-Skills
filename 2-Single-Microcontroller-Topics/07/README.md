#  Debounce Switch

Author: Rubeena Zaveri, 2018-10-26

## Summary

I wrote a program that eliminated the switch bounce. I sampled the input signal and toggle the LED for each change in switch state. This is such that there are clear times when the switch is pressed and not being pressed. I then attached the scope (Analog Discovery board) to the GPIO pin and captured the transient when the button was pressed.
