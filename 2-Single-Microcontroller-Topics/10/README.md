#  Use GPIO to Drive LEDs

Author: Rubeena Zaveri, 2018-09-22

## Summary

I used the GPIO to toggle signals on and off to control a set of LEDs. The program I wrote set the LEDs to blink in binary. I wrote a while loop that set the LEDs to the appropriate state (on or off) depending on their value. Each LED was assigned a value: 1,2,4 and 8.

I also able to, from my console, write specific numbers onto the 4-bit LEDs.
