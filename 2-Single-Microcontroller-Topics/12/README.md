#  Use PWM to control the LEDs

Author: Rubeena Zaveri, 2018-10-26

## Summary

I used PWM to drive a single LED in two different ways.

1. Designed and implemented console control to set an intensity level and then set the LED to that level.
2. Created a program that simulated a fade effect with the LED
