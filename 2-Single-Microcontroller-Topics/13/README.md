#  Stopwatch

Author: Rubeena Zaveri, 2018-09-22

## Summary

I built a stop watch with a pushbutton and the alphanumeric display. On the button press the timer counted up in seconds and displayed this on the alphanumeric. When the button was pressed again it stopped the timer, the third press reseted the display.
