#  Servo

Author: Rubeena Zaveri, 2018-09-22

## Summary

I attached the servo to the ESP32 and experimented with the range of it. My servo had a range from 600 to 3000. I used the mcpwm_servo_control example file and edited it so that it accounted for the range of my servo. I wrote a simple function that moved the servo from its 0 position to 180Ëš from there.
