#  IR TX/RX

Rubeena Zaveri, 2018-20-11

## Summary

Our team constructed the IR receiver and transmitter on the bread board. We programmed the ESP32 UART to receive 2400 Baud on the IR input channel. We were able to send received bytes to the console and read the message sent to us via the beacons.
