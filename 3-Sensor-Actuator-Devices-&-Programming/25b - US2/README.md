## Summary

Our team programmed the ESP32 rx/tx channels to read from the ultrasonic sensor. Ultrasonic sensor 2 uses two pins, a trigger and an echo, in order to gather data. A pulse is sent via the trigger and the time between triggering and receiving is measured. This time correlates to a distance and can be converted to this value using the equation: Test distance = (high level time Ã— velocity of sound (340M/S) / 2.
