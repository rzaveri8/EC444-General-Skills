#  Webcam

Rubeena Zaveri, 2018-20-11

## Summary

Use the Rpi to implement a server that streams a webcam feed.


## Method:

I "SSH'ed" in the RPi and was able to configure the webcam by sending certain commands to the RPi. This resulted in an IP address that could be accessed and a webcam feed was sent to that IP address
